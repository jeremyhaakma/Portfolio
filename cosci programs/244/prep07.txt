Preparation questions week 07

1) Reads bytes and decodes to character streams

2) best efficiency: wrap it in a buffered reader:

BufferedReader in
       = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

3) readLine() returns a String, not including termination characters, or null

4) prints a string and terminates the line. Returns nothing (void)

5) Creates a server socket bound to the specified port

6) Listens to a connection and accepts it. Blocks until connection is
   established.

7) Socket(InetAddress address, int port)

8) returns input stream for reading bytes from the socket

9) getOutputStream()

10) Initialised to the current time


11) System.out.printf(stdout, new Date());

12) Prints the port and host information
    <port> gives the port number,
    [host] gives the host name, if there is one.
