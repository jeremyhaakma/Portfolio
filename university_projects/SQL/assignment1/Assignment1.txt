I have chosen the convenience store as my miniworld. The database stores information about the products sold


Convenience Store:
	    Entities, Attributes, Relationships

	    Entities:
                -Brand
            
		-Product:

		   Retail Price ($)
		   Sell Price ($)( derived: Retail - promotion discount)
		   Section (String)(Relationship)
		   Number in stock (int)
		   Next order (date)(derived)
		   
		-Section
		   Name (String)
		   Products(Relationship)
		   Number of Products (derived)
		   
 		-Orders

		  Number (int)
		  Arrival date (date)

		-Promotions
		  Discount ($)
		  Conditions ???
		  Product (Relationship)
		  Start date

		  Duration (date range)(derived)

	   Relationships:
		ORDER_TYPE
		    N:1 relationship
		    A product can have multiple orders, but an order
		    can only be for one product
		PROMOTION_TYPE

		    A promotion can include multiple products, but a
		    product can only be a part of one promotion at a time
	    	BELONGS_TO

		    A section can have many products, but a product belongs
		    to only one section.
