1) 
	a) coach was set on fire or the coach set something on fire
		- syntactic ambiguity
   b) robber tickled under the man's chin, or tickled a man while he was under a chin
   		- syntactic ambiguity
   c) actually won a "pullet surprise", or speaker is referring to a Pulitzer Prize
   		- semantic ambiguity
   d) All refers to everything or just "all that glitters"
   		- syntactic ambiguity
   		
2)  
	a) use an n-gram model with n >= 1. For example, with n=1, it will find the prior 
	P distribution of two words; to find the probability of the next word in the sentence, it will
	calculate the conditional probability of that word based on the prior probability of it and the
	last word in the sentence. 
   b) with a small n, not enough context is given
   c) With a large n, rare words appear too rarely to get good estimates
   d) For each word with different meanings, identify which meaning is used in the training corpus, 
   then do an n-gram with each word meaning taken into account.
   
3) 
	a) The Elman network goes through the corpus word by word, training to predict the next word
	using back propagation. It also uses the hidden layer from the last time point as another input
	b) The Elman model is similar to the n-gram in that it uses the probabilities learned from the
	previous words. It differs in that it does not have a set 'n' number of how many words back it
	goes.

      ii) P(S=NP+VP)=1 * P(NP=N+N)=.17 * P(VP=V+NP)=.25 = .04

      iii) It correctly determines that the second interpretation is more likely. This is because
      		the first requires unlikely rules to occur, such as a noun phrase being made of two
      		nouns (i.e Time Flies)
