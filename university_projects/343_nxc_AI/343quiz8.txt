1.	a) Sample Space:
		All of the possible states of a function.
	
	b) Random Variable:
		A variable with a number of possible values, chosen randomly based on their
		relative frequency.
	
	c) Event:
		A range of points within the sample space.
	
	d) Prior probability:
		The probability of an event occurring without taking into account other
		conditions.
	
	e) Conditional probability:
		The conditional probability of event E1 is how likely it is to occur knowing
		that event E2 has occurred.
		
	f) Probability Distribution:
		A function that produces the probabilities of each possible value of a random
		variable.
		
2. 	a) 	i: p(Gloomy) = 1/3
		ii: P(English/\Gloomy) = 3/12
			P(Gloomy) = 4/12
			P(English|Gloomy) = 9/12 = 0.75

		iii:P(Owns_Jandals/\Goes_whitebaiting/\Can_cook_pavolva/\Kiwi) = 2/12
			P(Owns_Jandals/\Goes_whitebaiting/\Can_cook_pavolva) = 2/12
			P(Owns_jandals|Goes_whitebaiting|Can_cook_pavlova|Kiwi) = 1
